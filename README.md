# Project-06-3DRPG


## Implementation

added the following:

- a third-person animated character that can move with keyboard and mouse control, with camera movement 

- changed the model from the base Third Person Model.

- Added at least one mixamo animation.

- added terrain and objects with which you can interact
- applied a PBR texture to at least one mesh in your game
- Added non-player agents (enemies or others) that behave according to a rudimentary AI

- a dialogue-based conversation with one agent 

- one hand-held item (weapon or other) with which you can interact with the agents and/or the environment

- a scoring system

- a clear objective

Interesting features (beyond the scope of the assignment)
- I made my own hand-held item (sword)
- I made my own enemies (The ghosts)
